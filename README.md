# Reproducible Evaluation of Camera Auto-Exposure Methods in the Field: Platform, Benchmark and Lessons Learned

This repository contains the code used in our paper *Reproducible Evaluation of Camera Auto-Exposure Methods in the Field: Platform, Benchmark and Lessons Learned* submitted to Transaction on Field Robotics for the ICRA2024 Workshop special issue.

The repository will grow in the following days, but for now, you can access the original BorealHDR dataset and code from our IROS2024 paper *Exposing the Unseen: Exposure Time Emulation for Offline Benchmarking of Vision Algorithms* at the following link [BorealHDR](https://github.com/norlab-ulaval/BorealHDR).
